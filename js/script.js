// Does your program have an interface? What will it look like?
// The program will have a user interface. The grid-like look will be achieved by using borders on divs.

// What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
// First, the user will be able to select whether they want to play against another player (locally) or against a computer.
// This interaction will be achieved via buttons. Then the user or users will be able to click on individual grid cells
// in order to play the game.

// Whatâ€™s the desired output?
// There will be three different possible outcomes. The user can either window, lose, or draw. The user can
// win by placing 3 X markers either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Once one of these occur, the
// result should be displayed, and a button should appear in order to restart the game.

// Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output? The algorithm in pseudo code for this problem:
// When the user clicks on one of the 9 possible cells
// Check whether or not that cell is empty. Cells are items in an array, by default they are undefined.
// If the cell is empty, update the value of the cell in the array, and change the content of the cell to the user marker.
// User2 or computer's turn: same process.
// How to check if the markers connect vertically, horizontally or diagonally?
// gameBoard = [0, 1, 2,
//             3, 4, 5,
//             6, 7, 8]
// HORIZONTALLY:
// If the first 3 items in the array are the same, game over.
// If the 4th, 5th, and 6th items are the same, game over.
// If the 7th 8th and 6th items are the same, game over.
// VERTICALLY:
// If the first, 4th, and 7th are the same, game over.
// If the 2nd, 5th, and 8th are the same, game over.
// If the 3rd, 6th, and 9th are the same, game over.
// DIAGONALLY:
// If the first, 5th, and 9th are the same, game over.

// If 3 markers connect, and the marker is X, then the user won. If 3 markers connect, and the marker is O, then user lost.
// If no empty cells are left, and there is no 3-way connection, then its a draw.
